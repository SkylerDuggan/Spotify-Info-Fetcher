# Spotify-Track-Info-Fetcher
This simple Python application will take spotify URLs (The ones you can get when you highlight and copy songs in the Spotify desktop app) and output the information about the song. I built this to use for generating music suggestions with ChatGPT or any other AI chatbot.

# How to Use:
1. Open Spotify desktop app and go to a playlist
2. Ctrl+A to select all the songs within the playlist (or select however many you want)
3. Ctrl+C to copy all the songs
4. Open up the python application through Dev Enviroment or command line
5. Paste selection into the top box
6. Press the "Get Tracks" button
7. Wait
